# pdf-it-safe

Tobias-local hardened fork of `mrslbt/pdf-it`.

Do not install this checkout with `npx pdf-it-mcp@latest`. Use the pinned local build:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Tobias\projects\pdf-it-safe
npm ci
npm run build
node C:\Users\Tobias\projects\pdf-it-safe\dist\index.js
```

For Claude/Codex MCP config, use the pinned wrapper:

```powershell
C:\Users\Tobias\projects\pdf-it-safe\scripts\run-pdf-it-safe.cmd
```

Security deltas from upstream:

- Raw HTML in markdown is disabled.
- JavaScript is disabled while Chrome renders the PDF.
- External browser requests are blocked during rendering.
- Remote Google Fonts were removed; only local/system fonts are used.
- PDFs can only be written inside `~/Documents/pdf-it/`.
- Chrome is no longer launched with `--no-sandbox`.

See [`TOBIAS_SECURITY.md`](./TOBIAS_SECURITY.md) for the pinned baseline and verification steps.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and Claude Code skill that turns markdown into PDFs that look like they were made on purpose. Cover page, table of contents, code blocks that hold across page breaks, page-numbered footer. One command from your Claude session to a file you can send to a client.

![pdf-it cover example](./examples/cover.png)

## Why this exists

Every Claude Code research session ends the same way: a wall of useful markdown and no clean way to turn it into a PDF a person would actually want to read.

Chrome print: takes 30 seconds, output looks like a Word doc. Manual HTML conversion: 10 minutes per document. Pandoc: works but defaults look like a 2008 academic paper. None of it produces an artifact you would send to a client.

`pdf-it` is one command. The output is designed by default.

![pdf-it body example](./examples/body.png)

A 12-page sample is in [`examples/designing-ai-agent-uiux.pdf`](./examples/designing-ai-agent-uiux.pdf).

## Works with

`pdf-it-safe` is a local Model Context Protocol server. Any client that supports local MCP over stdio can use it, but Tobias' configured targets are Claude Code and Codex.

Hard requirements on any client: Node.js 18 or newer, Google Chrome installed, the client must support local MCP.

## Install

Use this local checkout, not npm `latest`:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Tobias\projects\pdf-it-safe
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

## Configure

Claude and Codex are already configured on Tobias' machine to run:

```powershell
C:\Users\Tobias\projects\pdf-it-safe\scripts\run-pdf-it-safe.cmd
```

Generic MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-it-safe": {
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": ["/c", "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\projects\\pdf-it-safe\\scripts\\run-pdf-it-safe.cmd"]
    }
  }
}
```

If Chrome lives somewhere non-standard, pass `CHROME_PATH` in the MCP environment.

## Use

In any Claude session connected to the server, ask:

> Save this as a PDF

Or any of these phrasings: `export as PDF`, `make a PDF report from this`, `turn this into a PDF`, `/pdf`. The skill picks up the request and routes it through pdf-it. The output lands in `~/Documents/pdf-it/` by default.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `generate_pdf` | Convert markdown into a PDF. Accepts a template (`research-report` or `plain`), optional title and author for the cover, and an optional output path. |
| `list_templates` | Return the list of available templates with descriptions. |

### `generate_pdf` parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `content` | yes | Markdown string to convert |
| `title` | no | Shown on the cover and in the page footer |
| `author` | no | Shown on the cover |
| `output_path` | no | Absolute `.pdf` path inside `~/Documents/pdf-it/`. Defaults to `~/Documents/pdf-it/{slug}-{timestamp}.pdf` |
| `template` | no | `research-report` (default) or `plain` |

## Templates

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `research-report` | Cover page with title, author, and date. Auto-generated table of contents from H1 and H2 headings. Body with proper hierarchy. Footer with title and page number. Best for research, summaries, design docs, reports. |
| `plain` | No cover, no TOC. Dense body content only. Best for short notes and quick exports. |

## Skill

This package ships with a Claude Code skill at `SKILL.md`. Trigger phrases the skill responds to:

- `save this as PDF`
- `export as PDF`
- `make a PDF report from this`
- `turn this into a PDF`
- `generate a PDF`
- `/pdf`

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the full skill spec.

## Examples

The [examples](./examples) folder has a sample generated PDF (`designing-ai-agent-uiux.pdf`, 12 pages) and the cover and body screenshots used in this README.

## Output

By default PDFs are written to `~/Documents/pdf-it/{slug}-{timestamp}.pdf`. Pass `output_path` only for another `.pdf` path inside `~/Documents/pdf-it/`.

## Design

System fonts only. The renderer uses local serif, sans, and monospace stacks, pure white paper, near-black ink, neutral hairline borders, and no accent colors. Code blocks render without syntax highlighting on purpose: color choices in PDFs age badly.

If you want a different design language, fork the templates and adjust. They live in `src/templates/` and are plain HTML and CSS rendered through Puppeteer.

## How it works

1. **Parse:** `markdown-it` converts your markdown to HTML with raw HTML disabled and auto-generates a table of contents from H1 and H2 headings.
2. **Template:** the HTML is wrapped in templated CSS using local/system fonts and a neutral palette.
3. **Render:** Puppeteer launches your local Chrome in headless mode with JavaScript disabled and browser requests blocked, then prints the HTML to PDF with proper page-break logic.
4. **Footer:** `pdf-lib` adds a page-numbered footer programmatically, skipping cover and TOC pages.
5. **Output:** the PDF lands in `~/Documents/pdf-it/{slug}-{timestamp}.pdf`.

Total time: 2-3 seconds for a 5-page document, 8-10 seconds for a 30-page document.

## Recognition

Upstream `mrslbt/pdf-it` is listed on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-it-mcp), [Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/mrslbt/pdf-it), [LobeHub](https://lobehub.com/mcp/mrslbt-pdf-it), [mcp.so](https://mcp.so/), and [mcpmux](https://mcpmux.com/). This fork is Tobias-local and should be run from the pinned checkout.
